// video task 1
 book('The Magicians Nephew');

 function book(title) {
    console.log(`The book is called ${title}`);
 }

// ANSWER: the book has not been declared yet, so it will not run

// video task 2
// let book = 'The Silver Chair';

// console.log(book);

// ANSWER: expected outcome: reference error. I would fix this by moving the console.log below the declaration
